- 👋 Hi, I’m @helgaParis - even though I left Paris recently
- 👀 I’m interested in people, code, arts, learning and teaching 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit more of security, apis, using middleware safely
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. If they imply NodeJs, React or allow me to learn new things, the better. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
